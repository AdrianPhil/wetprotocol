On the biosample page 
I could see some buttons for CRUD operations like:
    add new biosample on the biosamples page
    add child after a sample is selected. That would pop up a dialog with only the selected bioType fields.
    delete selected sample
    
    
At this point selecting a sample/right click and Add Child yields an error dialong with no text
    
It would be good if we could make sure a specific biotype can know what are children acceptable biotypes. Accept only...
